Known bugs:
1. AWT Thread Issues (Issue #1)
	- EDT in AWT & Swing won't terminate correctly sometimes if you use io.github.javaherobrine.net.ui.SocketUI
	- Solution: kill this process when everything is done
2. No Unicode support in io.github.javaherobrine.net.ui.SocketUI (Issue #5)
 	- Unicode characters will be split into many wrong ASCII characters and displayed wrongly in the screen
 	- Solution: store them in a file and use text editors
