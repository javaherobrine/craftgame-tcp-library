# CraftGame TCP Library
## craftgame-tcp library is independent after April 18th 2021
It still synchronizes with repository javaherobrine/CraftGame and it used to be a part of CraftGame

It includes a C/S library and a TCP connection debugger which allows you to send and receive plain text directly. You can use it to send a HTTP request, send an email through a SMTP server, etc.

`new Thread(new SocketUI(new Socket(host.port))).start();` works.
